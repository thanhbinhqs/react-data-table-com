# Advanced Data Table - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Provide a comprehensive, feature-rich data table component for managing and analyzing large datasets with advanced filtering, sorting, and interaction capabilities.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can efficiently navigate, filter, sort, and manipulate large datasets (100+ rows) with smooth performance and intuitive interactions.
- **Experience Qualities**: Professional, efficient, responsive

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality with state management)
- **Primary User Activity**: Interacting and analyzing data

## Core Problem Analysis
The application addresses the need for a robust data table solution that can handle:
- Large datasets with good performance
- Complex filtering and sorting requirements
- Row selection and bulk operations
- Column customization and resizing
- Modern, accessible UI patterns

## Essential Features

### Data Display & Navigation
- **Column Management**: Resizable columns with min/max constraints, sticky columns (pinned left/right)
- **Row Selection**: Multi-row selection with checkboxes, click-to-select functionality
- **Automatic Numbering**: Sequential row numbers that adjust with filtering
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout for different screen sizes

### Filtering & Search
- **Global Search**: Search across all columns simultaneously
- **Column-specific Filters**: Individual filters for each column with sidebar interface
- **Date Range Filtering**: Specialized date range picker for date columns with calendar interface
- **Smart Filter Detection**: Automatic detection of date columns for appropriate filter types
- **Filter Controls**: Apply and clear functionality with visual feedback

### Sorting & Organization
- **Multi-column Sorting**: Sort by multiple columns with visual indicators
- **Persistent State**: Maintain sort order through operations

### Actions & Operations
- **Row Actions**: Configurable dropdown menus for individual row operations
- **Bulk Actions**: Operations on multiple selected rows
- **Context Menus**: Right-click context menus for quick actions
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Safety prompts for destructive operations

### Performance & UX
- **Loading States**: Spinner overlays during data operations
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle transitions and hover effects
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence with subtle sophistication
- **Design Personality**: Clean, modern, data-focused
- **Visual Metaphors**: Traditional spreadsheet paradigms with modern web interface patterns
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Balanced - feature-rich but not cluttered

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with selective accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Professional blue (`oklch(0.6 0.15 240)`) - conveys trust and stability
- **Secondary Colors**: Neutral grays for backgrounds and borders
- **Accent Color**: Warm orange (`oklch(0.7 0.15 45)`) for highlights and active states
- **Color Psychology**: Blue creates professional trust, orange provides friendly highlights
- **Color Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios throughout

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) for consistency and data readability
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear size and weight distinctions between headers, data, and metadata
- **Font Personality**: Inter conveys modern professionalism and excellent readability
- **Readability Focus**: Optimized for tabular data with consistent spacing
- **Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts) - excellent for UI and data display

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Headers sticky at top, actions aligned right, selection on left
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding for touch targets, minimal gaps between related elements
- **Grid System**: Flexible column-based layout with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Responsive Approach**: Horizontal scrolling for wide tables, collapsible sidebar on mobile

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle hover effects to indicate interactivity
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Loading spinners, gentle transitions on state changes
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal, professional animations that don't distract from data

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: 
  - Shadcn components for consistent styling
  - TanStack Table for data management
  - Lucide icons for visual consistency
- **Component States**: Clear hover, active, focus, and disabled states
- **Icon Selection**: Lucide icons throughout for modern, consistent iconography
- **Spacing System**: Tailwind's spacing scale for consistent rhythm

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance minimum, AAA where possible
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full table navigation with arrow keys and tab order
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and table semantics

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Handle 100+ rows smoothly, virtualization for larger datasets
- **Testing Focus**: Column resizing, selection persistence, performance with large datasets
- **Critical Questions**: How to balance feature richness with performance

## Recent Updates
- **Date Range Filtering**: Added specialized DateRangePicker component using react-day-picker
- **Smart Filter Types**: Automatic detection of date columns for appropriate filter UI
- **Enhanced Filter Logic**: Custom filter functions for date range comparisons
- **Icon Library Migration**: Migrated from Phosphor Icons to Lucide React for better consistency and modern iconography
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved column resizing and sticky header behavior
- **Enhanced Interactions**: Added context menus and improved bulk action workflows

## Technical Implementation
- **DateRangePicker Component**: Custom wrapper around react-day-picker with Calendar UI component
- **Filter Type Detection**: Automatic identification of date columns based on column names
- **Custom Filter Functions**: TanStack Table custom filter functions for date range filtering
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper DateRange type exports

## Reflection
This approach uniquely combines enterprise-grade functionality with modern web UX patterns, making complex data operations feel natural and efficient. The migration to Lucide icons enhances visual consistency while maintaining the professional aesthetic.
